# Cancer Tumor Detection

This repo contains code for the Cancer Detection Kaggle competition which was used for a coding assignment for a Deep Learning Coursera course. 

## Problem Description

The goal of this project is to create an algorithm to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. The data for the project is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset. For each picture, the model must predict if the center 32x32 region contains at least 1 pixel of tumor tissue. Refer to the jupyter notebook inside the `jupyter_notebook folder` for the graphs and etc.
